At the top you will see your room's url which you should send to your friend. The game will begin when another player will enter the room. Both players must open the same url for the game to begin. If the game doesn't start then you're in different rooms. Please be sure that you're on the same url.<br/>

<b>Play with a stranger.</b>If you don't have an opponent to play with you, don't be upset. You can spend some time playing Rock Paper Scissors with a random stranger. Please click a “Random stranger” button and the game will find an opponent for you. Usually it takes around 10-20 seconds. When the opponent is found, the game will begin automatically.<br/>
